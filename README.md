Real-time Object Detection in the Browser
This is a simple, single-page web application that performs real-time object detection using your computer's webcam. It leverages the power of TensorFlow.js to run a pre-trained machine learning model directly in the browser, without a backend server or complex setup.

The application can identify and label a wide range of common objects, including people, electronic devices, furniture, and more, as they appear in the camera's view.

How to Use
Save the file: Save the entire code as a single .html file (e.g., index.html or object-detection.html).

Open in a browser: Open the saved file in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

Grant camera access: When prompted, allow the browser to access your webcam.

See the results: The application will immediately start showing your webcam feed with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.

Technologies Used
HTML & CSS: For the basic structure and styling of the web page.

JavaScript: To handle the camera stream and manage the detection process.

TensorFlow.js: The core machine learning library that runs the object detection model in the browser.

COCO-SSD Model: A pre-trained object detection model provided by TensorFlow.js, used for identifying a variety of common objects.

Project Features
Real-time Detection: Analyzes the video stream from your webcam at a high frame rate.

Browser-based: Everything runs locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and speed.

Bounding Boxes: Draws boxes and labels around detected objects with a confidence score.

Minimalist Design: A clean, easy-to-understand user interface.

Next Steps
Consider enhancing this project by adding new features, such as:

Counting Objects: Add a counter to display the number of objects of a specific class (e.g., "3 people detected").

Customization: Allow users to change the bounding box colors or confidence threshold.

Snapshot Feature: Add a button to capture and download a screenshot of the video feed with the detection results.
