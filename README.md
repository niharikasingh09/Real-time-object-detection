üìñ About the Project
This is a simple, single-page web application that performs real-time object detection using your computer's webcam. It leverages the power of TensorFlow.js to run a pre-trained machine learning model directly in the browser, without needing a backend server or complex setup.

The application can identify and label a wide range of common objects, including people, electronic devices, furniture, and more, as they appear in the camera's view.

üöÄ Getting Started:
To get the application up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites:
You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to run this application.

Installation:
No installation is required. The entire application is contained within a single HTML file.

Save the file: Save the entire code as a single .html file. You can name it index.html or object-detection.html.

Open in a browser: Open the saved file directly in your preferred browser.

Grant camera access: When prompted, allow the browser to access your webcam.

See the results: The application will immediately start showing your webcam feed with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3: For the basic structure and styling of the web page.

JavaScript: The core logic for handling the camera stream and managing the detection process.

TensorFlow.js: The machine learning library that enables running the model directly in the browser.

COCO-SSD Model: A pre-trained, lightweight object detection model for identifying common objects.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Detection: Analyzes the video stream from your webcam at a high frame rate.

Browser-based: Everything runs locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and speed.

Bounding Boxes: Draws boxes and labels around detected objects with a confidence score.

Minimalist Design: A clean, easy-to-understand user interface.
